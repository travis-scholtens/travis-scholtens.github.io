  <p>
   The TrueSkill and TrueSkill Through Time skill rating systems are
   generally useful in ranking players in a population by skill level
   by inferring skill levels from the outcomes of multiple games.
   But in cases where players compete in leagues separated into divisions
   by skill level, and primarily
   compete within their own division in a given season, the inferred
   skill levels are unreliable. High level players in one division
   may be incorrectly ranked alongside less competitive players in
   another, and as a consequence the model loses predictive accuracy,
   particularly in games between players from different division.
   By inferring
   skill independently among the players of each division, and then
   estimating skill differences across divisions, we improve upon
   the accuracy of both TrueSkill and TrueSkill Through Time in
   predicting the outcomes of future competitions.

   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
    The TrueSkill skill rating system (Herbrich <i>et al.</i> 2006)
    represented a significant improvement over previous efforts,
    such as the Elo system used in chess, by using Bayesian inference
    to estimate skill levels rather than relying on heuristics.
    TrueSkill Through Time (Herbrich <i>et al.</i> 2007) built on
    this approach by allowing the outcomes of later competitions to
    influence the skill estimates at earlier times, and allowing for
    the evolution of players' skill levels over time.
   </p>
   <p>
    Both of these systems produce skill estimates that are more
    successful than Elo ratings
    when predicting the outcomes of new games. But both systems'
    accuracies decrease when the matchups among players are not
    distributed uniformly.
   </p>
   <p>
    In particular, when players are formally divided according to experience
    or skill, as is often done in recreational sports leagues,
    TrueSkill can fail to accurately capture the skill differences
    between players in different divisions.
   </p>
   <p>
    If players never
    compete across divisions, then no global rating can be inferred
    without additional information. But in many real world organizations,
    interdivisional matchups are relatively rare but not uncommon,
    whether they take place
    in practice matches, open tournaments outside of league play, or
    due to substitutions when a player needs to temporarily "play up" to fill
    an open position in a higher division team's lineup.
