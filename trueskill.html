   The TrueSkill and TrueSkill Through Time skill rating systems are
   generally useful in ranking players in a population by skill level
   by inferring skill levels from the outcomes of multiple games.
   But in cases where players compete in leagues separated into divisions
   by skill level, and primarily
   compete within their own division in a given season, the inferred
   skill levels are unreliable. High level players in one division
   may be incorrectly ranked alongside less competitive players in
   another, and as a consequence the model loses predictive accuracy,
   particularly in games between players from different division.
   By inferring
   skill independently among the players of each division, and then
   estimating skill differences across divisions, we improve upon
   the accuracy of both TrueSkill and TrueSkill Through Time in
   predicting the outcomes of future competitions.
