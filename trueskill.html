 <h1>TrueSkill for Divisions</h1>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
   We present an extension of the TrueSkill and
   TrueSkill through time algorithms in the case of competitive
   leagues where players are separated into divisions, and primarily
   compete within their own division in a given season. By inferring
   skill independently among the players of each division, and then
   estimating skill differences across divisions, we improve upon
   the accuracy of both TrueSkill and TrueSkill through time in
   predicting the outcomes of future competitions.
